This code is about the Least Squares Regression (LSR) method for subspace segmentation for our work:
Can-Yi Lu, Hai Min, Zhong-Qiu Zhao, Lin Zhu, De-Shuang Huang and Shuicheng Yan. Robust and Efficient Subspace Segmentation via Least Squares Regression, European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.

The code is provided for research purposes only.

For motion segmentation on the Hopkins 155 database, one should first download the motion data from http://www.vision.jhu.edu/data/hopkins155/, and release the data in the .\Data subfolder. Then run Experiment_MS.m directly!

Please contact Can-Yi Lu (canyilu@gmail.com) for questions about the code.
